  "winePairing>pairingText": "Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, and Sauvignon Blanc are my top picks for Salmon. To decide on white or red, you should consider your seasoning and sauces. Chardonnay is a great friend to buttery, creamy dishes, while sauvignon blanc can complement herb or citrus-centric dishes. A light-bodied, low-tannin red such as the pinot noir goes great with broiled or grilled salmon. The Paul Dolan Vineyards Chardonnay Wine with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 20 dollars per bottle."

  "winePairing>pairingText": "Fish on the menu? Try pairing with Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The \"Gregoris\" IGT Pinot Grigio delle Venezie with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 14 dollars per bottle."
